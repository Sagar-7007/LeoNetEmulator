# LeoNetEmulator
This repository provides an extended version of the LEONetEM framework for emulating Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, specifically Starlink-like bent-pipe architectures, using Mininet. It supports real-time latency trace injection, traffic generation via ICMP, iPerf (UDP), and GStreamer (RTP audio), and detailed QoS/QoE analysis through packet capture (.pcap) inspection. The framework enables reproducible experiments for evaluating satellite-induced impairments such as jitter, packet loss, and handover delays. Ideal for researchers and developers exploring network protocol behavior under dynamic LEO satellite conditions.
